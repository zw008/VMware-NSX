"""A delete that failed must be audited as a failure, not just *read* as one.

``@vmware_tool`` records a call as failed when an exception reaches it, or when
the returned payload is a dict (or one-element list) carrying a truthy
``error`` key — the family's documented envelope. This skill's five delete
tools return a **string** instead, because a delete has nothing to return but a
sentence. A string is not sniffed, on purpose: a skill that hands back console
text can legitimately emit output beginning with "Error:" as data, and marking
that call failed would be the same lie in the opposite direction.

So a caught delete failure looked exactly like a success:

1. the audit row said ``status=ok`` for a delete that did not happen — in a
   family whose stated purpose is a trustworthy audit trail, an affirmatively
   wrong row is worse than a missing one;
2. the circuit breaker was told ``success=True``, so repeated failures against
   a sick manager could never trip it.

``report_tool_failure`` is the explicit signal for exactly this shape, and it
has to run *inside* the ``@vmware_tool`` call still in flight — which the
decorator order (``@mcp.tool`` → ``@vmware_tool`` → body) already guarantees.

The assertion is on the **audited status**, never on the returned string: the
string was always right, and reading it back would re-test the thing that never
broke.
