"""The MCP server's cache and the resolver must not disagree about which file.

Background, 2026-08-30. The config-path precedence — explicit argument, then
``VMWARE_NSX_CONFIG``, then ``CONFIG_FILE`` — was consolidated into
``resolve_config_path``, because it had been written out in three places and no
two of them agreed. A fourth statement of it appeared to remain, in the shared
``vmware_policy.mtime_cached_loader`` that the MCP server wraps ``load_config``
in, and it lives in another package where this skill cannot consolidate it.

Reading it closely, it is **not** a fourth copy of the rule for *which file to
open*: when the variable is unset it passes ``None`` to the loader and lets the
loader resolve. It states the precedence only to decide *when the cache is
stale* — so a disagreement here would produce a stale or over-eager cache, never
a wrong file. That is a much smaller failure than the one being fixed, but it is
still a hot-reload contract quietly broken, and nothing checked it.

So this asserts the two agree, rather than merging them. What it pins:

* the path the cache stats is the path the loader ends up opening, in every
  state of the variable — including the empty string, where "set but empty" must
  not diverge between them;
* the ``default_path`` the server passes is the same ``CONFIG_FILE`` the
  resolver falls back to (if these drifted apart, the cache would stat one file
  while the loader read another, and an edit to the real config would never be
  picked up).

    in this file is therefore satisfied by a resolver that ignores the variable
    completely (verified: that mutation passes them all).

    That is not hypothetical. It is exactly how four sibling skills came to have
    the agent and the human on different vCenters — their servers honoured the
    variable through this loader while their ``load_config`` did not, and
    nothing failed, because the server was never relying on the clause that was
    missing.

    So the assertion is on the *bare* call, the one the CLI and the doctor make.
