"""Closed-value parameters must carry their values in the MCP schema.

A tool parameter with a fixed set of valid values used to be typed `str` with
the values named only in prose. An MCP client sees the schema, not the prose, so
a model had to guess the spelling -- and guessing wrong did not raise. It
silently did something else:

  * vmware-monitor ranked an unrecognised severity with `SEVERITY_ORDER.get(sev, 1)`,
    so a typo filtered at warning level and returned a plausible, wrong list.
  * vmware-nsx chose a gateway with `"tier-0s" if gateway_type == "tier0" else "tier-1s"`,
    so anything not spelled exactly `tier0` silently addressed **tier1** --
    including on `delete_static_route`.

`Literal[...]` puts the values in the schema, where the client rejects a bad one
before it reaches any of that.

This gate pins each enum against the set the implementation actually accepts, so
the two cannot drift. The NSX case is why that matters: `create_nat_rule` accepts
six actions and its docstring named three, so an enum copied from the prose would
have turned a documentation gap into a hard rejection of three working values.
