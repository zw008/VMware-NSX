"""Every MCP write tool must land in this skill's own audit log, as the CLI's do.

This repo has two audit sinks and they answer different questions.
``~/.vmware/audit.db`` is the family's shared SQLite trail, written by
``@vmware_tool`` for both surfaces; that one was never broken here and
``test_returned_failure_is_audited.py`` covers it. ``~/.vmware-nsx/audit.log``
is this skill's own JSON-Lines log — the file ``README.md`` advertises as
holding "All operations", the file ``vmware-nsx`` writes on every CLI write via
``cli._audit.log``, and the file an operator on the box actually opens when
asked what changed on the NSX manager.

Nothing on the MCP surface ever wrote to it. So a segment deleted by an agent
was absent from the log a human's identical ``vmware-nsx segment delete`` had
just appeared in, and the sibling repo — whose MCP write tools call
``_audit.log`` in every tool body — had the property this one lacked. That is
CLAUDE.md 形态 #7 exactly: a family pattern present in one repo and missing in
the other.

The write set here is **derived** from the tools' own MCP annotations rather
than hand-listed, so a fourteenth write tool fails this suite until it audits
too. A test naming today's thirteen would stay green while the surface grew
past it. ``test_the_write_set_is_derived_not_inherited`` cross-checks that
derivation against an independent one (the verb the tool's name starts with),
so a write tool that mislabels itself ``readOnlyHint: True`` cannot slip out of
the set the fix and the test share.
