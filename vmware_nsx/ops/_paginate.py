"""Shared limit/offset validation and the next-page signal for list ops.

The family envelope (``vmware_policy.envelope.paginated``) has six keys and
every one describes the page in hand: how many rows came back, the limit that
produced them, the collection size, whether this is all of it, and a sentence
about that. None of them says where the *next* page starts, so a tool that
takes an ``offset`` still leaves an agent with nowhere to go.

``truncated`` is not that signal and cannot be made into one. It answers "is
``items`` the whole collection?", which stays true on the last page of a paged
walk — page three of three holds one row out of ten. A loop driven by it never
terminates. So the ops here add a ``next_offset`` extra alongside the six, and
that is what a loop stops on.

    A *negative* limit is worse than ambiguous: ``items[offset:offset + limit]``
    is legal Python that quietly returns a shorter page than asked for, so the
