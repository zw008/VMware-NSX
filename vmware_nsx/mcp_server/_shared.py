"""Shared MCP primitives: the FastMCP instance and the error sanitizer.

Tool modules under ``vmware_nsx.mcp_server.tools`` import ``mcp`` (to register tools),
``_safe_error`` (agent-safe error formatting), and ``_DOCTOR_HINT`` from here.
The connection helper lives in ``vmware_nsx.mcp_server.server`` instead, so that tests can
``patch("vmware_nsx.mcp_server.server._get_connection")`` and have every tool pick it up;
tool modules therefore call ``server._get_connection(...)`` at runtime.

def _safe_error(exc: Exception, tool: str) -> str:
    """Return an agent-safe error string; log full detail server-side only.

    Raw NSX exception text can carry response bodies, internal paths, or
    host:port pairs. Full traceback goes to stderr (operator-visible); the agent
    sees only a control-char-stripped, length-capped message.

    The rule is a property, not a list: every exception this skill raises on
    purpose passes through, and only genuinely unplanned ones are reduced. That
    covers the builtin validation errors, the connection layer's teaching errors
    (``NsxApiError``), and ``ConnectionError``, which ``connection.py`` raises
    when session creation succeeds but no X-XSRF-TOKEN header comes back —
    a message that names the proxy-stripping cause and the config keys to check.

    The missing-password error — this family's most common first-run failure,
    whose entire remedy is the env var name it carries — arrives as
    ``ConfigError``, a narrow ``OSError`` subclass ``config.py`` raises on
    purpose. Bare ``OSError`` is deliberately *not* here: it would also admit
    ``socket.gaierror`` (the name that failed to resolve) and ``requests``-style
    connection errors (the full ``scheme://host:port/path``), neither of which
    is authored text. ``sanitize`` strips control characters and truncates; it
    redacts nothing, so breadth here is exposure.

    ``FileNotFoundError``, ``PermissionError``, ``TimeoutError`` and
    ``ConnectionError`` stay: each is narrow, each was already reachable through
    the ``OSError`` entry this replaces, and their text describes the operator's
    own environment rather than the manager's response. Two are raised here
    deliberately — ``FileNotFoundError`` for a missing config file, and
    ``ConnectionError`` for the missing X-XSRF-TOKEN case above.

    ``ssl.SSLError`` is reduced *before* the allowlist is consulted, because an
    allowlist structurally cannot say "not this one":
    ``ssl.SSLCertVerificationError`` inherits from ``ValueError`` as well as
    ``OSError``, and ``ValueError`` has been allowed since long before any of
    this. Its message quotes the certificate subject and the hostname. Only
    ``ssl.SSLError`` is pre-checked — ``socket.gaierror`` and
    ``ConnectionRefusedError`` have ``OSError`` as their only base, so removing
    ``OSError`` already reduces them, and naming them here would make the guard
    promise more than it does.

    That pre-check cannot fire on this skill's own transport path, and saying so
    matters more than the guard does: httpx raises ``httpx.ConnectError`` for a
    TLS failure, which is not an ``ssl.SSLError`` subclass, and
    ``connection.py`` translates it into an allowlisted ``NsxApiError``. What
    keeps the certificate subject out of agent context here is that
    ``connection.py`` no longer interpolates the raw exception into that
    message. The pre-check is defence in depth for an ``ssl.SSLError`` arriving
    by some other route, and is verified against a constructed one.

    Anything else is reduced to its type — an unplanned exception's text was
    written for a developer reading a traceback, not for an agent choosing what
    to do next, and it is the one that can carry credentials.
