    Returns per-port admin_state, attachment (type/id) and realized state:
    attached, realized_bindings_count, transport_node_ids. NSX does not expose a
    single UP/DOWN flag per segment port — an attached port with realized
    bindings on at least one transport node is healthy. Only the first 50 ports
    are returned.

    Start here for "why can this VM not reach the network?" — it is the only
    tool mapping a VM name onto NSX topology. Looks the VM up in the fabric
    inventory, fetches its VIFs, and matches segment ports by
    lport_attachment_id. Returns one dict (not the list envelope): VM info
    (external_id, host, power state) and matched_ports (segment id/name, port
    id/name). Matching is on exact display name, and empty matched_ports means
    no VIF is attached, not that the VM is missing.

    are not managed here — use vmware-aiops.
