"""Give the MCP write surface the skill audit log the CLI surface already has.

Two sinks exist and they are not redundant. ``~/.vmware/audit.db`` is the
family's shared SQLite trail that ``@vmware_tool`` writes for every tool call on
every skill; nothing here replaces or duplicates it. ``~/.vmware-nsx/audit.log``
is this skill's own JSON-Lines log — the one ``README.md`` advertises, the one
``cli._audit.log`` appends to on every CLI write, and the one an operator opens
on the box when asked what changed on the NSX manager. Until this module, no
MCP tool had ever written a line to it, so ``vmware-nsx segment delete`` left a
record there and the ``delete_segment`` tool did not.

**Why a registration-time sweep and not a per-tool call.** The sibling repo
closes the same gap by calling ``_audit.log(...)`` in each write tool body. That
works until someone adds tool fourteen, and CLAUDE.md 形态 #7 says that is what
happens: a marker every tool has to remember is a marker some tool will forget,
which is why the family put credential redaction in the shared decorator rather
than in per-tool declarations. Here the property is derived from the same thing
the tool already declares to the client — ``readOnlyHint: False`` — so a new
write tool is audited before anyone has thought about it, whatever route it took
to registration.

The sweep rebinds both the FastMCP registry entry and the attribute on the
module that defined the tool. Rebinding only the registry would leave
``vmware_nsx.mcp_server.server.delete_segment`` — which ``server.py`` re-exports
and much of this repo calls directly — pointing at the unaudited function.
